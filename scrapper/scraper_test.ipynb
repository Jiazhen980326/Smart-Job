      "      The Feline Medical Clinic is adding a 5 th Doctor to our hospital team in Vancouver, Washington. We are certified as a Silver-level Cat Friendly Practice. We have a dedicated client base which has supported us for decades (we were founded in 1977 and have been AAHA-certified since 1979). Clients typically have finances to pursue diagnostic and surgical treatments. Client education about cats is... still a large part of our daily practice. Our staff is a team which strives to improve and upgrade our care. Most team members have been with us for many years. Three licensed techs and multiple highly-skilled and trained assistants are our basis for excellence. We support the entire team to help us all do our jobs well and with long-term career goals in mind. The doctors all share cases and treat by the same protocols so mentorship is part of our daily practice. This also means casework continues uninterrupted on scheduled days off for each doctor. We are not on call, nor do we have late hours. We support a work-life balance, and the calendar is set months in advance so it is possible to schedule important vacations and events outside of work and be able to count on this time. We have a vacation policy which is granted during the first year of practice after an initial probation period. We are close to hiking, biking, and beach recreation. We have a strong interest in the ABVP and are active in our support for becoming board-certified in feline practice. We encourage attendance at, and budget for, at least one major meeting for each doctor every year. We have digital dental radiography (and include full mouth dental radiographs with every dental) and standard digital radiology machines as well as high-quality patient monitors as recommended by AAHA standards. We also have a butterfly ultrasound machine we are learning to incorporate into our diagnostic tree. We have brand new surgical and dental LED lighting and an LED swivel dental drill for the dental procedures we routinely perform.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are interested in our practice and becoming our new doctor (and we welcome new graduates for this position), please send a letter of interest and resume to the email address below. We try to address inquiries promptly, but if the doctor who is overseeing the hiring is on vacation or a weekend off (all the doctors get at least one long weekend per month) it may be a few days before a reply is made. We will do our best to make ALL applicants feel welcome.\n",
